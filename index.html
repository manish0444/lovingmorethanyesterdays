          <p class="body">I hope this message finds you well, despite the complexities of life. It's been on my mind for a while now, and I felt it's essential to express my thoughts to you.</p>
          <p class="body">Even if we aren't in each other's lives right now, please believe that my feelings for you remain. I want nothing more than to see you joyful and thriving, even if it means doing so without me around.</p>
          <p class="body">I wish you all the happiness and success in the world, and if being apart from me brings you that happiness, then I accept it with an open heart. If you ever need a friend or a supportive voice, remember that my care and concern for you remain steadfast. thanks for being with me on those hard times. so as my small gratitude towards your love and support on back days i have something for you. <a href="flower.html">OPEN IT</a>
