          <p class="body" style="text-align: justify;">

<br><br> Where do I begin? From the moment I first saw you in 9th grade, I was spellbound. Your beauty, your grace, your kindness - you were unlike anyone I had ever met. For years I have watched you from afar, too nervous to approach you, too afraid of rejection to confess my feelings. Yet my affection for you has only grown with time. We are in college now, and still I cannot take my eyes off you. You are beyond perfection, Diyashna. Your smile makes my heart skip a beat. The sound of your laugh fills me with joy. Being near you is like being in the presence of an angel. I know it sounds cliché, but it's the truth. I'm sure you must have many admirers. Why would someone as wonderful as you even notice a nervous, bumbling fool like me? And yet, I can't silence these feelings anymore. I have to let you know how I feel, even if you cannot return my affection.
<br><br>When we graduated 10th grade, I was afraid I would never see you again. But by some miracle, we ended up at the same college! Those first glimpses of you in college thrilled me more than any acceptance letter. My only regret was that we were not in the same class, so our paths rarely crossed. I'm sure you must wonder why I'm rambling on about you like a lovesick fool. The truth is, Diyashna, I have been captivated by you since 9th grade. Time has only made my feelings grow stronger. I have kept this secret buried for so long, but I can stay silent no more.
<br><br>I don't know how you will react to knowing you have a shy, devoted admirer. Perhaps you will find it silly or embarrassing. Maybe you never noticed me among the crowds of people drawn to your light. But I had to finally gather the courage to confess these feelings, even if just on mere words. This is not simply a crush or infatuation. What I feel for you goes beyond anything I've experienced before. It's true that your beauty immediately grabbed my attention. But as I got to know you over the years, everything about you only made me love you more. Your smile makes time stand still for me. The sound of your voice, your laughter, is music to my ears. Being near you fills me with indescribable happiness, and yet nervous butterflies at the same time. I hang onto every word when we speak, wishing our all-too-brief interactions would never end.
<br><br> You occupy my thoughts in the most pleasant ways. Just thinking of you makes my pulse quicken and a smile spread across my face. I find myself lost in daydreams about you when I least expect it - what you're doing, what you're thinking, how you'd react if you knew the depth of my admiration. I drift off to sleep picturing your beautiful eyes and smile and wake up eager to see if today will be the day I finally speak my heart. 

I know you're surrounded by countless admirers, vying for the affection of someone as remarkable as you. With your warmth, intellect and beauty, you must have your pick of anyone you desire. Compared to them, I am likely invisible to you, just another face in the crowd. This makes me hesitate to reveal my humble affections. Why would someone like you notice someone like me? 
<br><br>
But I can no longer stay silent, keeping these feelings bottled up. I must take a chance, put my vulnerabilities before you, even if it means potential heartbreak. For the possibility you might reciprocate, no matter how slim, makes any pain worth enduring. I'd rather know for certain if there could ever be an "us" than forever wonder "what if?" You are worth leaping into the unknown for, dangers be damned. I hope beyond hope you feel even a fraction for me what I feel for you. That would make me the luckiest soul alive.
<br><br>Diyashna, my feelings for you are so complex, I struggle to find the words. When I'm with you, it's like my heart wants to leap from my chest. Your smile makes me feel lighter than air, while your absence leaves me heavy with longing. I ache to be close to you, yet feel paralyzed by fear. "Love is like a gentle stream - it may begin as a trickle, but given time and care, it can grow into a mighty river, carving through stone and nourishing life along its banks." You have awakened that stream in my heart, Diyashna. I'm afraid to confess the depth of my affection, worried I'll scare you away. But my longing to share everything with you overwhelms me. I want to bare my soul, even as uncertainty leaves me tongue-tied. You awaken such intense emotions, beautiful and terrifying all at once.
<br><br>How do I explain this exquisite torture you put me through? Moments with you are rapturous, yet I dread you'll tire of me. I'm terrified I'll say the wrong thing and drive you away forever. Yet keeping my feelings locked inside is its own kind of agony. I know relationships require vulnerability. But opening my heart is something I've always struggled with. Past pain taught me caution, but with you I desperately want to take the leap. I'm just so afraid you won't catch me. "Real love does not demand constant ecstasy, but grows stronger through life's ups and downs if tenderness and trust remain." I know with you by my side, our love will only deepen.
<br><br>Still, our connection feels different than any I've known before. When we face each other in college, it's like the world stands still. I get lost in your eyes, as if no one else exists. I cherish every second, even as I worry it's all too good to last. "Love is not a destination, but an ongoing journey of growth and discovery. There will be twists and turns, but they will only bring us closer if we stay side by side." I can't wait to see where this journey takes us. But I don’t know if I ever could be yours even after the afterlife. Even if my words falter, know that my heart speaks volumes. I'm ready to take this leap into love with you. Through light and shadow, calm and storm, I want to walk this path together wherever it leads. Say you'll take my hand, Diyashna. This journey awaits us.
<br><br>I don't know how to articulate this maelstrom inside me. Putting words to such potent emotions seems impossible. I only know that what I feel for you eclipses anything I've felt before. It's at once exhilarating and terrifying in its intensity. You've unlocked something in me, Diyashna. My heart feels wide open and vulnerable around you in ways both thrilling and frightening. I want to surrender completely to this bond between us, yet fear still holds me back. Will you accept the full force of my feelings if I lay myself bare?
<br><br> I know relationships require a leap of faith. True intimacy means embracing the ups and downs together. It means taking a chance, even when the future is uncertain. And you are worth that leap to me. What we share resonates in my very bones, on a level I cannot put into words. My connection to you transcends the logical and defies explanation. It can only be experienced, soul to soul. I feel you like a missing piece of myself I never knew was absent until now. I don't know where this journey will take us, my dear Diyashna. But I want to travel with you, hand in hand. My heart is open, despite the fear. For you, I will find the courage to speak my truth, even inadequate as words may be. All I can do is try to articulate these inexpressible feelings, and trust you will understand.
<br><br>This letter may be my one chance to let you know how cherished and adored you are. My one opportunity to explain the depth of my feelings for you, Diyashna. Feelings I have held closely guarded for so many years. Being near you is the highlight of my days, my weeks, my life. If I could make you as happy as you make me simply by existing, I would consider myself the luckiest person on earth. To be able to hold your hand, to laugh together,  to call you mine - it's the stuff of my most cherished dreams.
<br><br>I'm sure this confession must seem silly to someone as wonderful as you. And I would completely understand if you do not reciprocate these intense feelings. But I could not live with myself without you knowing the effect you have on me. You deserve to hear how beautiful you are, inside and out. How your smile outshines the sun and seeing you laugh brightens the darkest day. The way everything fades into the background when you enter a room. I am utterly devoted to you, Diyashna. My heart is yours, if you will have it.
<br><br>
I wish I had the courage to approach you, to move beyond superficial conversations about school and really get to know the real you. To learn what makes your soul come alive - your hopes, dreams, passions that spark that light in your eyes. What makes you laugh out loud with abandon, or smile that gorgeous smile that melts my heart? 

I want to discover all the little details about you that others overlook. How do you take your coffee in the mornings? What songs do you sing along to when you think no one is listening? What are your secret talents? There is so much more beneath the surface that I long to explore if you'd let me.
<br><br>
My heart flutters uncontrollably when I spot you in a crowd. Your face is the one I search for, hoping to catch just a glimpse. I find ridiculous excuses to be near you, thinking of elaborate reasons to start a conversation, even if it's just for a moment. I cherish those brief encounters, replaying each word, look, and smile you give me though they are fleeting. 

I wish I had the courage to tell you how I really feel, to lay my heart bare before you. But my feelings scare me, and rejection would crush me. So I watch silently from afar, wishing someday I will find the boldness to approach you, get to know the real you, and discover if a chance for something more exists between us. For now, I'll settle for those brief moments fate gifts me, waiting hopefully for the day my dreams might come true.
<br><br>Perhaps you think I'm some foolish, stammering boy with a childish infatuation. In a way, you'd be right - when I'm around you, I feel as tongue-tied and dizzy as a kid with their first crush. But my feelings for you, Diyashna, come from a deeply genuine place, even if I cannot eloquently convey them. You deserve to be appreciated, admired and showered with affection. I wish I had the wisdom and confidence to show you each day how treasured you are. While I may only be able to offer you the fumbling devotion of an ardent admirer, my feelings are true.
<br><br>My hands tremble as I fold this letter, a fragile vessel carrying the storm of emotions within me. I wouldn't blame you for finding it childish, this spilling of my heart onto paper. But words, Diyashna, hold a special power when spoken by a tongue too tied to confess them aloud. This letter holds more than words; it holds the shy glances you've never noticed, the nervous chuckles I swallow in your presence, the dreams woven with threads of your smile.
<br><br>Perhaps, one day, I'll gather the courage to weave those dreams into reality. To walk under the shade of the same tree where we once shared laughter, to whisper your name into the breeze that dances through your hair. To show you the boy hidden behind the timid facade, the one who finds poetry in your kindness, music in your laugh, and a universe in the depths of your eyes. Until then, this letter is my secret compass, guiding me towards your presence, even if it's only from afar. Each time you grace the halls of our college, my heart takes a detour, drawn to your orbit like a starstruck planet. Every smile you share with another feels like a bittersweet melody, my joy at your happiness battling with the longing to be the reason for that smile.


With a heart full of hope and a touch of trepidation,
          </p>
        

          <p class="body" style="text-align: justify;">
            But I won't let my fear cast a shadow on your light, Diyashna. You deserve to blossom like the vibrant flower you are, to paint the world with your laughter and chase away the darkness with your kindness. Even if I remain unseen in the periphery, I'll be your silent admirer, cheering you on, celebrating your victories, and whispering unspoken prayers for your happiness. This letter may be the end of my confession, but it's not the end of my devotion. You'll always be the sunshine in my cloudy days, the melody that calms my restless nights. And who knows, maybe someday, my voice will gather the strength to sing those unspoken songs, and perhaps, just perhaps, you'll listen.
            <br><br>I wish I could offer you the moon and stars, or shower you with the most extravagant gifts to express how I feel about you. But material things could never encapsulate the depth of my affection. What I can give you is the sincerest offering of my heart.

            From the moment I first met you, I was captivated by your gentle grace and quiet strength. Your beauty resides not just in your outward appearance, but emanates from your compassionate spirit. Being near you fills me with a sense of peace and tranquility I've never known before.
            
            When we're apart, I think of you constantly, gladdened by the memories we've created together, however brief. My days are brighter simply knowing you are in the world. You've awakened something in me I never dreamed possible.
            
            Although I don't have luxurious presents or grand gestures to declare my feelings, I hope you will accept this humble confession. Please know that I care for you deeply, beyond material trappings or showy displays. If you feel even a fraction of what I do, I can ask for nothing more.
            
            Having you in my life would be the greatest gift of all. Where this path leads, I cannot say - but I know that my heart belongs to you, today and always. <br><br> Here's something for you, though it might not be surprising or special. <a href="flower.html">OPEN IT
